Goal oriented

I'm not sure if it's my personality or how my first work experience forged my caracter, but I am simply goal oriented at work.

At work, more than anything, I enjoy delivering. 

I believe it to be an interesting quality in the data science industry, because with the enormous number of technologies, technics and 
applications, it is easy to get lost. I like to jump straight away to the part where I add value to a project, to a business, to 
a problem.
