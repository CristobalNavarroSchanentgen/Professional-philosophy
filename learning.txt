Learning from content

I personnaly like open online classes for interesting and interdisciplinary subjects (mit open classroom has a great computer science collection
for instance) and specific content (textbooks, specialized websites, wikipedia, youtube...) for specific skills I feel like learning.

Learning from practice

However serene I feel about my understanding of a topic or my mastery of a skill, I just like to practive over and over. Keeps me from worrying 
about forgetting, helps make it a second nature AND usually end ups encouraging new insights. 

Learning from people

It's not so much about transmitting knowledge. I believe learning from people is important because they transmit experience, which contains 
both the knowledge and the human challenges associated with actually using that knowledge for problem solving. In the end, that is unvaluable.
